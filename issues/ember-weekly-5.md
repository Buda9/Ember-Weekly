A must read if you're an Ember Data user or waiting for it to stabilize.

[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)

Mentioned in the Ember Data Progress Update but warrants it's own headline. The standard interchange format being defined for conventional communication between client/server. Work in progress and open to feedback. [(jsonapi.org)](http://jsonapi.org/)
